# ECOQUEST Sustainabile Simulation (Option Choosing) Game

An option choosing game built with [Phaser 3.86.0](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser). The objective of the game is to survive 10 rounds while maintaining Environment Health, Economic Stability, and Public Satisfaction by choosing a sustainable option in each round.

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install project dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Launch a development web server |
| `npm run build` | Create a production build in the `dist` folder |
| `npm run dev-nolog` | Launch a development web server without sending anonymous data (see "About log.js" below) |
| `npm run build-nolog` | Create a production build in the `dist` folder without sending anonymous data (see "About log.js" below) |


## Writing Code

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development server by running `npm run dev`.

The local development server runs on `http://localhost:8080` by default. Please see the Vite documentation if you wish to change this, or add SSL support.

Once the server is running you can edit any of the files in the `src` folder. Vite will automatically recompile your code and then reload the browser.

## Template Project Structure

We have provided a default project structure to get you started. This is as follows:

- `index.html` - A basic HTML page to contain the game.
- `src` - Contains the game source code.
- `src/main.js` - The main entry point. This contains the game configuration and starts the game.
- `src/scenes/` - The Phaser Scenes are in this folder.
- `public/style.css` - Some simple CSS rules to help with page layout.
- `public/assets` - Contains the static assets used by the game.
